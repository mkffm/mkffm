# mkffm
A script for building a small but usefull static ffmpeg binary from sources, with "most wanted" software support included.
Builds without problems in ubuntu 14.04 and UP and Debian 8.x
You must have no "-dev" packages installed in your system, to ensure portability of the resulting binary.
All contributions are welcome
